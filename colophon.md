This is a static website hosted on GitHub Pages using Jekyll to handle templating. The puzzle engine is written in Typescript using React. The entire game runs locally in your browser and nowhere else.

All source code for the site–including past, current, and future puzzles–is available on GitHub in the [`thzinc/regexed`][github] repo. Puzzles that are in development are found in the `_spoilers` folder.

Puzzles are attributed to their author and created by a human.

This site uses [Plausible][plausible] for privacy-respecting site analytics.

This site does not use cookies.

Player data is stored in your browser's [localStorage][mdn] and is not sent or transmitted out of the browser.
